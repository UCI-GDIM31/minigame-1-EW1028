Devlog:
In my opinion, I think of a Scene as a stage that a performance. Each GameObject is like an actor or an actress on that stage, a dancer, a prop, or light. Components are what give each performer their own personailtiy and own abilities. The brightness of the light or the script of props, or dancers' choreogrraphy. Components themselves cannot stand on the stage, however, after being attached to the game object, they define the function of the GameObject. When all the GameObjects and their Components perform together in the Sence, the work comes alive.
